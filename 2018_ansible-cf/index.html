					- Smooth Deployments
					- Cookie-cutter Environments
					- Secure Operations

				<section>
					Tenets of IaC
					- Task Development
					- Knowledge Decentralization
					- Context Separation
					- Shared Accountability
				</section>

				<section>
					Toolset Overview
					IaC Deep Dive
					- Principle
					- Practice
					- Code Sample
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						Ansible
						- Agentless Automation Toolset
						- Keyword:
							- Inventory (hosts)
							- Playbooks (automation)
							- Roles (services)
							- Tasks
							- Variables
						</section>

					<section>
						Ansible Playbooks
						- yml, j2 in
						- ssh, python out
					</section>

					<section>
						Ansible Tasks
						- simple: copy, apt, bash
						- complex: cloud, database, monitoring
					</section>

					<section>
						ansible yml sample

						Cloudformation
						- AWS Resource Provisioning
						- Keywords:
							- Templates (yml)
							- Resources
							- Parameters 
							- Mappings
					</section>

						AWS Interactions
						1. CLI
						2. CloudFormation
						3. Web Console

				<section>
					Automation of Repeatable Tasks
					- Every task must be in source control
					- Complex tasks are made up of simple ones
					- Highest level is Business abstraction

					How to source control
					- Pick something Small and Integral
						- File delivery
						- Service start
					- Use ansible tasks, or aws resources
					
					How to complex over simple
					- Use ansible roles, playbooks
					- Keep it simple, sequential

					DevBusOps
					- #1 criticism of DevOps is that it's not value
					- Building business-facing controls negates
					- Batch size can exactly match feature with very little cost
				</section>

				<section>
					Decentralization of Complex Knowledge
					- Don't reinvent the wheel
					- Review regularly
					- Let the code speak for itself

					Don't reinvent the wheel
					- Prefer OTC Solutions
					- Use ansible modules
					- Use vendor tools (CF)
					- Put command strings in run.sh files

					Review Regularly
					- Code review every deployment change
					- Refactor before changes to keep it tidy

					Let the Code Speak
					- README.md answers the most basic questions
					- ./**/README.md answers more specific questions
					- Filenames are like object names
					- task or resource names are like function names
				</section>

				<section>
					Separate Product from Context
					- Move all environment info into variables
					- Build an environment switch
					- Layer/Tag environments (nonprod, load)
					- Prefer immutability 
				</section>

				<section>
					Boost Security with Shared Accountability
					- Implement vaults
					- Use deployment roles instead of super admins
					- Implement auditing and logging
				</section>

				<section>
					Where we want to be
					- 100% Automation (eliminate procedural variance)
					- Handle any state (handle environmental variance)
					- Practically Zero dependency sharing (reduce dependency complexity)
					-> Make deployment a business process

				<section>
					Where we are/were
					+ Different environments for different SLAs, audiences
					+ Same binary everywhere (except for mobile, embedded)
					- Still have manual actions
					- Assess state before deployment

					Infrastructure Operations
					- Provisioning (Bun)
					- Installation (Burger)
					- Secrets (Sauce)
					- Configuration (No Pickles)
					- Operation (Bite)

					As Code
					- Requirements
						- Provision a resource
						- Move files
						- Find/Replace
						- Run service
					- Source Control
						- Rebuild in case the server dies (immutability)
						- Back up the 'what'
					- Code Reviews
						- Agree on syntax, methods
						- Share knowledge
					- Quality Assurance
						- Same deployment method from dev to prod
					- User Experience
						- Ops are people too

					Product!

					+ Consistency
					+ Speed
					+ Data
					+ Joy

					IaC Freedoms
					- Coding: Componentization of Repeatable Tasks
						- Renewing SSL Certs (ansible)
						- Applying Security Groups (CF)
					- Source Control: Decentralization of Complex Knowledge
						- Deploy logstash
						- Deploy cloudfront
					- Configuration Management: Segregation of Product and Context
						- multiple environments
					- Vaulting: Security through Shared Accountability
						- RSP Handbook, mandatory vacation
						- Dave becomes a contributor
							- Dave's password doesn't get shared with someone who isn't Dave
							- Dave cannot introduct malicious artifacts for risk of getting outted by the collective 
				</section>

				<section>
					Design Language
					- Think Production First
					- Prefer Idiomatic Solutions
					- Prefer Immutability
					- Prefer Idempotence
					- Prefer Flat Structure

					Case Study:
					- AWS Products (DynamoDB, Route 53, S3)
					- AWS Resources (RDS, EC2)
					- Non-AWS Resources (VMs)
					- Non-AWS Products (mongodb, logstash, docker)
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						What's Ansible
						- host: local or remote (ssh), static or enumerated (.py)
						- task: something performed on a host
							- as simple as file copy
							- as complex as installing a service
						- role: a series of tasks that collectively describe a capability
						- playbooks: a series of role and host associations
						- vaults: collections of encrypted strings and/or files 

						Game changers:
						- declarative syntax
						- established templating (do what you're best at)
						- agentless

					</section>
					<section>
						What's Cloudformation
						- AWS proprietary
